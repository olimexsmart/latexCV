    % \section*{{\aiOBP} About me}
    % Programming in general is my first interest, constantly challenging myself with new ideas and projects. 
    % My programming projects range from high level GUI application like an Android app (Olmaredo Stego) 
    % to embedded projects like an OBD2 telemetry interface for cars. Recently I've started to look into 
    % the Flutter framework, while at Hi-Lex I've been developing a fairly complex desktop application 
    % in Electron.
    
    % Electronics is my second interest, preferably digital than analog. More in detail, I developed 
    % several complex Arduino projects and experimented with the STM32 microcontroller ecosystem. 
    % At Hi-Lex the core product is based on a Melexis MCU, very challenging both from the point 
    % of view of the resources available and the development environment.
    
    % During my internship at Mainsim I first learned about web developing, mainly back-end but a with 
    % a touch of front-end too. This new set of skills allowed me to dive into the IoT paradigm that 
    % was when the core focus of the work in Deloitte.
    
    % While in my PhD experience, although not completed, thought me about complex algebraic computation 
    % in Python and C++, up to that point my coding was approached in a results ASAP approach. 
    % My recent experience in the automotive industry instead made me completely re-think 
    % my day-to-day work and the implications of my coding for the company, forcing me to focus instead 
    % on the solidity of the product, shifting to a writing less code but of high quality.
    
    % Finally, I try to keep my pragmatic approach fresh by
