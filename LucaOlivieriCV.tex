    \section*{{\aiOBP} About me}
    Programming in general is my first interest, constantly challenging myself with new ideas and projects. My programming projects range from high level GUI application like an Android app (Olmaredo Stego) to embedded projects like an OBD2 telemetry interface for cars. Recently I've started to look into the Flutter framework, while at Hi-Lex I've been developing a fairly complex desktop application in Electron.
    
    Electronics is my second interest, preferably digital than analog. More in detail, I developed several complex Arduino projects and experimented with the STM32 microcontroller ecosystem. At Hi-Lex the core product is based on a Melexis MCU, very challenging both from the point of view of the resources available and the development environment.
    
    During my internship at Mainsim I first learned about web developing, mainly back-end but a with a touch of front-end too. This new set of skills allowed me to dive into the IoT paradigm that was when the core focus of the work in Deloitte.
    
    While in my PhD experience, although not completed, thought me about complex algebraic computation in Python and C++, up to that point my coding was approached in a results ASAP approach. My recent experience in the automotive industry instead made me completely re-think my day-to-day work and the implications of my coding for the company, forcing me to focus instead on the solidity of the product, shifting to a writing less code but of high quality.
    
    Finally, I try to keep my pragmatic approach fresh by
