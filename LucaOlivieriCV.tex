\section{Key Skills and Interests}
	%\vspace{-7pt}
	Programming in general is my first interest, constantly challenging myself with new ideas and projects. My programming projects range from high level GUI application like an Android app (Olmaredo Stego) to  embedded projects like an OBD2 telemetry interface for cars. 
	
	Electronics is my second interest, preferably digital than analog. More in detail, I developed several complex Arduino projects and experimented with the STM32 microcontroller ecosystem.
	
	During my internship at Mainsim I learned web developing, mainly back-end but a with a touch of front-end too. This new set of skills allowed me to dive into the IoT paradigm with a series of recent projects.
