\section{Key Skills and Interests}
	%\vspace{-7pt}
	Programming in general is my first interest, constantly challenging myself with new ideas and projects. My programming projects range from high level GUI application like an Android app (Olmaredo Stego) to embedded projects like an OBD2 telemetry interface for cars. Recently I've started to look into the Flutter framework, while at Hi-Lex I've been developing a fairly complex desktop application in Electron.
	
	Electronics is my second interest, preferably digital than analog. More in detail, I developed several complex Arduino projects and experimented with the STM32 microcontroller ecosystem. At Hi-Lex the core product is based on a Melexis MCU, very challenging both from the point of view of the resources available and the development environment.
	
	During my internship at Mainsim I first learned about web developing, mainly back-end but a with a touch of front-end too. This new set of skills allowed me to dive into the IoT paradigm that was when the core focus of the work in Deloitte.

    The PhD experience, although not completed, thought me about complex algebraic computation in Python and C++ focused on performance. But I was approaching my coding with a results ASAP approach. My recent experience in the automotive industry instead made me to completely re-think my day-to-day work and the implications of my coding for the company, forcing me to focus instead on the solidity of the product, shifting to a writing less code but of high quality.
	
    Finally, I try to keep my pragmatic approach fresh by challenging my self with new technologies on personal projects. 
	
\section{Personal Projects}

Some of my tinkering that actually produced something meaningful:

\begin{entrylist}
  \entry
	{2022}
	{dumbPOS}
	{}
	{I've noticed that most local culinary events have the need of a low cost and simple POS system. I'm currently building a solution that connects a common receipt printer with to a backend built in Flask (Python) that server a one-page web application in Flutter. }
	\entry
	{2020}
	{Proselide - a startup}
	{}
	{I challenged my self to launch an idea and start a business. The problem I was trying to find a solution for was the monitoring of parking spaces, to avoid the pollution, traffic and general stress associated with looking for a parking spot. From a technical point of view, the idea was based around a low cost camera sensor and computer vision.}
	\entry
	{2018}
	{Front Door Opener}
	{}
	{Embedded system connected to the Internet serving a login page. Upon a successful login, the front entrance of the building is opened. This allows guest to enter by themselves or enables owners to simply enter without searching  for the key. Complete with an administrator page and logs. Custom-built board.}
    \entry
    {2018}
    {Boat Tracker}
    {}
    {A self-contained embedded system used to log the position of a boat through GPS. Data is sent to a server using GSM/GPRS communication. A comprehensive web page displays the paths logged.}
